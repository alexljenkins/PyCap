Capstone example of applying the learnings from PyCap intro to Python

## Problem
Create a web application using Python 3.6+ that allows you to build a financial dashboard. Your code should be well documented with a docstrings, comments and a README describing how your program works, unit tests to ensure it works as expected, type annotations to allow other developers to understand how to help build upon your program and finally well formatted code (using Black).

You should add a summary to your README that includes the next steps (dot points) and also the strengths and weaknesses of your program in its current state.

## Requirements:
- create read update delete (crud)
- Doc strings
- Type anno
- Unit tests
- readme

## ideas
- background processes
- celeary task
- take in user input to display a certain ticker
- collect data live from an API
- store data in an sqlite database (flat file first the update to sql)
- display graphs in some sort of layout
